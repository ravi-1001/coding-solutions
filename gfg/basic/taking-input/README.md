# Taking Input

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

You need to perform three separate tasks based on the given input:

- String Input and Print: Read a string s (which may contain spaces) and print it as it is.
- Integer Input and Print: Read an integer n and print it without any change.
- Float Input and floor Print: Read a floating-point number as input, take its floor value, and print as an integer.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "Hello", n = 20, f = 5.5
Output: 
Hello
20
5
Explanation: 
The string Hello is printed as it is.
The integer 20 is printed without any change.
For floating-point number 5.5, its floor value 5 is printed.

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s;
        int n;
        float f;
        int ff; // To Store floor of float variable f

        // code here
        s = sc.nextLine();
        n = sc.nextInt();
        f = sc.nextFloat();
        ff = (int) Math.floor(f);

        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(n);
        System.out.println(ff);
    }
}
```
